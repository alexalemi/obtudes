# World3

I'm reading [*Limits to
Growth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth).  In 1972, some
modelers attempted to model the planet over the next century or so and broadly
concluded that we were headed for trouble.

I'd like to try to replicate their model.  It seems like at a high level, the
model is a large set of coupled differential equations.  One thing I'd like to
add is some notion of uncertainty.  I'd like to run many simulations with
different values for all of the parameters and see what kind of variability
there is in the outcomes.

Overall, the model seems to be fairly complicated with a lot of variables.  I'm
wondering whether I should try to implement it or implement a whole dynamical
modelling framework in order to implement it.
